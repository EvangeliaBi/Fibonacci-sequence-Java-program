Code Analysis:

• package fibbo;  => Defines the package for the class file.

• public class Fibonacci { ... }  => Class that contains the main execution method.

• public static void main(String[] args) {  => The program's entry point.

• int[] fibonacci = new int[15];  => Creates an array of length 15 for the sequence terms.

• fibonacci[0] = 1;fibonacci[1] = 1;  => Initializes the first two terms of the sequence to 1.

• pinakas(fibonacci);  => Calls a method that fills and prints the array.

• static void pinakas(int[] fibonacci) {  => Method that receives the array, fills the remaining elements, and prints them.

• for(int i = 2; i < fibonacci.length; i++) { fibonacci[i] = fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2]; }  => Loop that calculates each new term as the sum of the two previous ones.

• for(int elem : fibonacci) System.out.print(elem + " ");  => Enhanced loop to print all elements in a single line.


Requirements:

• 	Java JDK 8+ installed


Possible improvements:
- Accept input data from the user.
- Use BigInteger for very large terms.
- Add checks for limits and error messages.
